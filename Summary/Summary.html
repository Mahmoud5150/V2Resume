        <p id="p">
            Mahmoud Abdulhameed, I'm a third year Computer Science student at Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal university.
            I'm interested in programming in general, but I'm currently trying to become a professional front-end developer.
            My first steps toward this goal was taking part in a course which teaches me that, and here's my first project in the course 
            using html and css.
